# A Multilingual Benchmark for Probing Negation-Awareness <br/> with Minimal Pairs
This repository contains the data for our Multilingual Benchmark for Probing Negation-Awareness with Minimal Pairs (CoNLL 2021). The idea of our work is to provide multilingual datasets that allow to investigate the extent to which pre-trained language models are aware of the semantics of negation markers. The datasets are manually derived from the multilingual [XNLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XNLI) datasets, and consist of minimal pairs of NLI examples that only differ in the presence/absence of a negation marker. For more information, checkout the associated [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TaF1vYWRyedG-uNJzdBak7lHls6up06l/view?usp=sharing) and [poster](./poster_negation_conll.pdf).

The repository contains the following data:
- the [lists of negation cues](./data/negation_cues) used to select NLI examples for the minimal pairs
- the [datasets of minimal pairs](./data/minimal_pairs) resulting from negation removal
